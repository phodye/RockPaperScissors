TOP Rock Paper Scissors Javascript Project

April 16, 2022
I've completed my first iteration of the RPS project. 
Still enjoying the TOP quite a bit, though this project was difficult. 
The most difficulty I had was tracking the results through each loop of the game and coming up with a final win/loss count. 
I addressed that by reducing the result output for each iteration to either "You win, you lose or you tie" and creating a function that added to a counter for each of the three options after every round. 
I'm not sure why my initial attempt to count any of the win or lose options to increase the count didn't work. 
I'm going to read the chapter on functions in Elegant Javascript and see if that leads to new ideas.
