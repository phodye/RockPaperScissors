TOP Rock Paper Scissors Javascript Project

May 2, 2022
I've added a UI to the Rock Paper Scissors project. Getting elements to stick where you want them to is more difficult than I anticipated. Adding animations would be nice- I would like the results box to flash everytime a round is played. I would also like to end the functionality of the page after five rounds are played an add a reset button.

I've completed my first iteration of the RPS project. 
Still enjoying the TOP quite a bit, though this project was difficult. 
The most difficulty I had was tracking the results through each loop of the game and coming up with a final win/loss count. 
I addressed that by reducing the result output for each iteration to either "You win, you lose or you tie" and creating a function that added to a counter for each of the three options after every round. 
I'm not sure why my initial attempt to count any of the win or lose options to increase the count didn't work. 
I'm going to read the chapter on functions in Elegant Javascript and see if that leads to new ideas.
